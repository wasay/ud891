Content 3: Quiz: Write your own focus styles

    This exercise can be found in the folder lesson6-styling/01-focus-styles within 
    this course's GitHub Repository.
    
    The buttons on this page donâ€™t currently have focus styles, making them pretty much 
    useless to a keyboard user. With your new CSS knowledge, try using the :focus 
    pseudo-class to give these buttons interesting focus states.

    Material Design Accessibility recommendations for touch targets
    
    Author's Note: On older browsers (particularly Mobile Safari) developers would 
    add user-scaleable=no because it would disable the 350ms click delay in that browser. 
    As of Safari 9.1 this is no longer the case, and using width=device-width in your 
    viewport will handle removing that click delay.
    
    
    tounch target
        
        48 db (device independent pixcels) minimum touch target
        
        if suppose image is 24 px, add additional padding to make it close to 48 pixcels
        
        32 px margin to avoid conflict with other touch items
        it should be both horizontal and verticlelly spaced

Content 17: High Contrast Mode

You can follow this link to get the Chrome High Contrast extension. Try it out on one of your 
sites to verify that everything works well for low vision users.

Author's Note: The example that shows a "subtle background color" in the navbar really does have 
a background color, we promise! It doesn't show up very well on YouTube, which I guess proves 
the point that just because a subtle color might look good on your screen doesn't always mean 
it'll look good on someone else's monitor.


Knowing when to apply rules:

    How frequently is this piece of UI used?
    
    How badly does this accessibility issue affect your users?
    
    How expendisve is it going to be to fix?
