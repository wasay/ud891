lesson 1: Web Accessibility Overview

Content 1: Introduction to Accessibility


    Welcome to the Web Accessibility course!
    
    Good accessibility or "a11y" is crucial to making sure all users can access the content 
    in your sites and applications. Making sure you consider accessibility at the start of 
    your process will ensure that your final product is more polished and works for more people.
    
    Throughout this course we'll have you do a number of hands-on exercises to get familiar 
    with accessibility topics and techniques. You can find all of the exercises in the 
    project's GitHub repo. Go ahead and clone it now so you can reference it when we 
    get to the quiz nodes.
    
    Note: We often shorten the word "accessibility" to "a11y" because there's 11 letters 
    between the "A" and "Y" in the word "Accessibility". Sometimes you'll see this pattern 
    used in other contexts like i18n for "internationalization" and l10n for "localization".

    Some statistics on disability for the US:
    
    Around 2% of the population has some kind of vision disability (i.e. are blind or have 
    significant difficulty seeing even with glasses)
    Around 50% of the population has some kind of clinically significant refractive error 
    (a visual impairment which may be corrected with glasses if mild enough)
    Around 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form of color vision deficiency
    Around 2% of adults have a hearing disability
    Over 4% have a cognitive disability (difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions)

Content 11: Quiz: Experiencing a screen reader

    Alright, it's time to start working with a screen reader. Head over to this sample page 
    and click the 'Enable ChromeVox Lite' button to get started. When you're finished, come 
    back here and enter the secret word.
    http://udacity.github.io/ud891/lesson1-overview/06-experiencing-screen-reader/
    
    Important: To navigate with ChromeVox Lite you will need to use the buttons at the bottom 
    of the screen. If you try to just click on the button with your mouse the page will lose 
    focus and you'll have to refresh and start over. So... no cheating! "ChromeVox Lite" is a 
    modified version of ChromeVox which is injected into some of the pages used in this course. 
    Using ChromeVox Lite is optional for all exercises - the examples should will work just 
    as well with the ChromeVox extension, or any other screen reader you may already be familiar 
    with. If you do choose to use ChromeVox Lite, it's very simple:
    http://www.chromevox.com/
    
    Enable ChromeVox Lite via the "Enable ChromeVox Lite" button in the bottom right hand corner 
    of the screen, or via the other "Enable ChromeVox Lite" button which appears if you press TAB once.
    
    The controls for ChromeVox Lite will appear once it is enabled:
    The "Voice" drop-down allows you to choose alternate voices
    The "Speech rate" drop-down allows you to make the speech faster or slower (if you find 
    yourself getting bored waiting for ChromeVox to finish what it's saying, try speeding it up!)
    The "Navigate" buttons allow you to move ChromeVox's focus to non-focusable items on 
    the page, such as headers
    
    Finally, the volume control allows you to fine-tune ChromeVox's volume.
